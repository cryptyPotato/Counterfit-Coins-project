# Counterfit-Coins-project
There are 12 identical coins where 11 weigh exactly same and one is different. How can you find the counterfit coin in minimum number of call to weighing scale. In this project we simulated solution for 8 coins and used IBM quantum computer to find the solution for 5 coin
